# Numenera Improved
The orginal plugin had mutiple incompatibility with Foundry v9 so I did a few fixes. Besides the popular little improvements to make it more compatible with the system language (Extra effort -> Assets, Cypher -> Numenera). I had trouble trying to make this as an update to the current version so I have renamed it to Numenera Improved. It is compatible with Numenera shared compendiums so you can migrate your games over easily.

## What is this?

This repository is support for various Cypher system roleplaying games for the [Foundry virtual tabletop](http://foundryvtt.com/#about-foundry-virtual-tabletop).

We currently officially support

* [Numenera](https://numenera.com/)
* [The Strange](https://thestrangerpg.com/)
* [Cypher System](https://cypher-system.com/)
* [Gods of the Fall](https://www.montecookgames.com/welcome-to-gods-of-the-fall/)

Don't know about them? Check them out!

## Features

See a mostly complete tour here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiK2A3iq8gY

* Sheets for PCs, NPCs, skills, cyphers... anything under the 9th World's sun!
* A full and flexible dialog to manage task levels and Effort: just press Ctrl and hold then click on the roll button to make it appear.
* Create macros from any rollable element: skills, abilities, etc.
* Unidentified cypher, artifact and oddity items so your players don't know what you've given them! (you _sneaky_ GM, you)
* Cypher and artifact items can either have a fixed level or a randomly-generated one from a formula (eg. 1d6+2). Once given to a PC, that level is determined randomly, but the GM may override that value if they wish.
* Players can create their own items or use pre-made ones, including weapons and armor
* Dice rolls explicitly tell you about minor and major effects, as well as free GM intrusions
* Built-in Task dialog: just Ctrl+click anything that allows rolling and you can then set target level, assets, effort, etc.
* A third health bar for PC tokens, to see every PC pool straight from the battle map

## How do I use it?

To install, simply go to the _Game Systems_ tab of the _Configuration and Setup_ screen, click the _Install System_ button on the lower left; scroll down to _Numenera_ and click Install.

Foundry will download the current bundle and afterwards you only need to create a new world using that system. Easy as pie!

## Can I help?

Of course you can!

First and foremost, use it! Use the system for your games and send any feedback you may have, good or bad, to me either directly through Discord or by creating an issue on Github. Show it to your friends. Broadcast it on national television. Everything helps.

Otherwise, I'm always looking for all kinds of help:

* wiki: this repo has a wiki and it would be a great place to document features and tips!
* translations: any language translations are welcome! Already translated:
    * English
    * French
    * Brazilian Portugese
    * German
    * Spanish
* layout: if you have any HTML and CSS skills, you're probably better at this than I am!
* feature development: there's a LOT of work ahead, so if you're familiar with Javascript, there's work to be done.
* docs: we're definitely lacking in documentation! Wiki documentation would be welcome: how-to videos would be really awesome, too.

Whatever the case, just get in touch.

## Requests

If you'd like something added or prioritized, just drop me a line! You can easily join me by creating in issue here or through the [Foundry Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/DDBZUDf).
